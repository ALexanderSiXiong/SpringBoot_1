1. By reading the “Playfair.pdf” document, you may gain an overall understanding of how has Playfair algorithm been designed or been operated. 
In compare to frequency analysis, the Playfair algorithm is significantly harder to break by using a secret passcode/key, which is unknown to cryptographer.     

2. For breaking the Playfair cipher text outlined in your Lab sheet exercise, you need to Obtain the decryption key (passcode) by breaking /decrypting the Cipher “Q2F0YWxpbmE=” 

Good Luck :)
